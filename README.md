# Parkinsons_Disease_Predictio# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient is suffering from Parkinson's disease based on audio/voice measures. Machine learning models are used to analyze the dataset and make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the file `parkinsons.data`. It contains 195 rows and 24 columns. Each column represents a different attribute related to the voice measures of the patients.

### Attribute Information:

-   **name**: ASCII subject name and recording number
-   **MDVP:Fo(Hz)**: Average vocal fundamental frequency
-   **MDVP:Fhi(Hz)**: Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
-   **MDVP:Flo(Hz)**: Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
-   **MDVP:Jitter(%), MDVP:Jitter(Abs), MDVP:RAP, MDVP:PPQ, Jitter:DDP**: Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
-   **MDVP:Shimmer, MDVP:Shimmer(dB), Shimmer:APQ3, Shimmer:APQ5, MDVP:APQ, Shimmer:DDA**: Several measures of variation in amplitude
-   **NHR**: Measure of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
-   **HNR**: Measure of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
-   **status**: Health status of the subject (1 - Parkinson's, 0 - healthy)
-   **RPDE, D2**: Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures
-   **DFA**: Signal fractal scaling exponent
-   **spread1, spread2, PPE**: Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation

-   Random forest model performs better compared to other models, with an accuracy of 94%.
-   Logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 84%.
-   Decision tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine models were also applied, but random forest yielded the highest accuracy.
-   The kappa score, a measure of agreement between predicted and true values, was calculated for the random forest model.

## Report

The analysis of the Parkinson's disease prediction based on audio/voice measures resulted in the following key findings:

-   Parkinson's disease can be predicted with a high level of accuracy using machine learning techniques.
-   Random forest model outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 94% in predicting Parkinson's disease.
-   Nonlinear dynamical complexity measure RPDE, NHR, and HNR were found to be important features in distinguishing patients with Parkinson's disease.
-   The dataset used in this project had a high number of patients affected by Parkinson's disease.

These findings indicate the potential of using audio/voice measures for early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, which can aid in providing timely medical interventions and support to patients.
